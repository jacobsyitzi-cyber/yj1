YJ - RCG Sales Reports (Working version)

✅ RUN (recommended)
1) Unzip somewhere LOCAL (avoid OneDrive if possible)
2) Double-click: Run_YJ-RCG_Sales_Reports.bat

First run installs requirements (slow).
Next runs are faster (it creates a .installed file).

⚠️ IMPORTANT
Do NOT run PyInstaller / EXE build commands for this Streamlit app.
Streamlit apps are meant to be launched with the BAT file above.
